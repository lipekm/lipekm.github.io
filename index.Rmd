My name is Katelyn Lipe and I'm a junior at Appalachian State University. I'm a Public Health major with a minor in Statistics. I work part-time at JCrew as a sales associate. 

I am apart of Alpha Gamma Delta International Fraternity and have served as Communty Service Chair and a part of the 2017-2018 Executive Council. In the Fall of 2018 I participated as an Appol Corps leader, which are guides for freshmen during their first weekend of college. I have been offered an internship with the Hunger and Health Coalition for the 2019 year, but I am serving as a volunteer until then. 

With my degree I hope to obtain a career that would allow me to help people and make an impact. I'm passionate about epidemeology and biostatistics.
